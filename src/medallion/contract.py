"""Write contract: what a job writes must match the table's DDL exactly, column for column.

Delta already rejects extra columns, NOT NULL violations and impossible casts, but it silently accepts two mistakes:
a missing nullable column (filled with null) and a type that can be cast (e.g. a double rounded into a DECIMAL). Both
would publish wrong data without an error, so jobs check the full schema before writing.
